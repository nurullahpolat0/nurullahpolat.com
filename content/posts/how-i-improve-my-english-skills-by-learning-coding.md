As we know, english is very important for all non-native english programmers. Specially if you consider to join global companies or want to be freelancer, you have to learn that language.

To be honest I am not good enough at english. if you are good in english, you will probably find a lot of grammar and meaning mistake at this article. I still learn and I try to use every day asap.

Most contents with regard to software on the internet are produced using English. It is a fairly common language in the tech world. That’s why I decided to learn English with coding. Without further ado, I will briefly explain it.

**1. Don’t use your mother tongue**
====================================

In general, most non-native English programmers tend to use their native language when developing software and solving bugs. However, if we want to reach numerous solutions and contents, we should learn and use English as much as possible. Also, I am Turkish, and there is not enough content in Turkish.

Because of these reasons, I started to learn English. After starting to use it, I am now able to find amazing content related to my job. I use my phone and computer in English. This method gets me used to English.

**2. Read at least one article every day**
=======================================

One of the ways to improve your english, specially at reading skills, is to read a lot. I read at least one or more article, blog everyday. It is very beneficial habit for my reading skills.

Mostly I read [**Medium**](https://medium.com/) blogs and also highly recommend you [**Hacker News**](https://news.ycombinator.com/) platform. You can find the latest or valuable articles about engineering.

**3.Expand your network**
=====================

Another way to enhance your english skill is to expand network. Almost all of people from the engineering industry are using some social platforms such as linkedln, twitter. I follow many software engineers on these platforms. Now I am talking a lot of people. They contribute to my English every time we talk.
